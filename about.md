Hi, I'm Alex - an AI/ML Software Engineer with end-to-end, full-stack experience in porting, optimizing, and deploying AI/ML models on RISC-V platforms, spanning the full pipeline from frontend model ingestion (PyTorch/ONNX) through compiler lowering (MLIR/IREE), runtime and driver integration, and on-device execution.

Hands-on experience porting, validating, and optimizing diverse AI workloads on RISC-V platforms, including BEVFormer for automotive, LLAMA3 for large language models, and other transformer-based architectures.

Experienced with mainstream AI frameworks such as PyTorch and ONNX, including custom operator registration and integration, as well as replacing CUDA/C++ kernels with RISC-V implementations via Python bindings.

Strong background in the MLIR ecosystem, including Torch-MLIR for lowering PyTorch models into MLIR, and IREE as an MLIR-based AI compiler and runtime, with experience in RISC-V and GPU code generation, custom kernel development, and implementing custom IREE runtime drivers for SiFive accelerators.

Solid understanding of PyTorch JIT compilation, including TorchDynamo mechanisms, graph capture, and supporting torch.compile with a RISC-V backend.

Familiar with modern LLM inference frameworks, including vLLM and llama.cpp, with hands-on experience evaluating and integrating them into end-to-end LLM workflows.

Hands-on experience with distributed computing and multi-device LLM execution, including model sharding via Tensor Parallelism (TP).
